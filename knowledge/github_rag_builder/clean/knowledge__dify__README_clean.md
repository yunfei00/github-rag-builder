Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features (including Opik, Langfuse, and Arize Phoenix) and more, letting you quickly go from prototype to production. Here's a list of the core features:

## Quick start

> Before installing Dify, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
>
> - CPU >= 2 Core
> - RAM >= 4 GiB

The easiest way to start the Dify server is through Docker Compose. Before running Dify with the following commands, make sure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at http://localhost/install and start the initialization process.

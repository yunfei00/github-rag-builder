title: Pydantic Programs
---

  Pydantic Programs are a lower-level abstraction for structured output
  extraction. The default way to perform structured output extraction is with
  our LLM classes, which lets you plug these LLMs easily into higher-level
  workflows. Check out our structured data extraction
  tutorial.

A pydantic program is a generic abstraction that takes in an input string and converts it to a structured Pydantic object type.

Because this abstraction is so generic, it encompasses a broad range of LLM workflows. The programs are composable and be for more generic or specific use cases.

There's a few general types of Pydantic Programs:

- **Text Completion Pydantic Programs**: These convert input text into a user-specified structured object through a text completion API + output parsing.
- **Function Calling Pydantic Programs**: These convert input text into a user-specified structured object through an LLM function calling API.
- **Prepackaged Pydantic Programs**: These convert input text into prespecified structured objects.

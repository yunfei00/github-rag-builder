##### 1. How to define a custom LLM?

You can access Usage Custom to define a custom LLM.

---

##### 2. How to use a different OpenAI model?

To use a different OpenAI model you can access Configure Model to set your own custom model.

---

##### 3. How can I customize my prompt?

You can access Prompts to learn how to customize your prompts.

---

##### 4. Is it required to fine-tune my model?

No. there's isolated modules which might provide better results, but isn't required, you can use llamaindex without needing to fine-tune the model.

---

##### 5. I want to the LLM answer in Chinese/Italian/French but only answers in English, how to proceed?

To the LLM answer in another language more accurate you can update the prompts to enforce more the output language.

```py
response = query_engine.query("Rest of your query... \nRespond in Italian")
```

Alternatively:

```py
from llama_index.core import Settings
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(system_prompt="Always respond in Italian.")

# set a global llm
Settings.llm = llm

query_engine = load_index_from_storage(
    storage_context,
).as_query_engine()
```

##### 6. Is LlamaIndex GPU accelerated?

Yes, you can run a language model (LLM) on a GPU when running it locally. You can find an example of setting up LLMs with GPU support in the llama2 setup documentation.

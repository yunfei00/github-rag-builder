title: Vector Stores
---

Vector stores contain embedding vectors of ingested document chunks
(and sometimes the document chunks as well).

## Simple Vector Store

By default, LlamaIndex uses a simple in-memory vector store that's great for quick experimentation.
They can be persisted to (and loaded from) disk by calling `vector_store.persist()` (and `SimpleVectorStore.from_persist_path(...)` respectively).

## Vector Store Options & Feature Support

LlamaIndex supports over 20 different vector store options.
We are actively adding more integrations and improving feature coverage for each.

title: Retriever Modules
---

We are actively adding more tailored retrieval guides.
In the meanwhile, please take a look at the API References.

## Index Retrievers

Please see the retriever modes for more details on how to get a retriever from any given index.

If you want to import the corresponding retrievers directly, please check out our API reference.

## Comprehensive Retriever Guides

Check out our comprehensive guides on various retriever modules, many of which cover advanced concepts (auto-retrieval, routing, ensembling, and more).

### Advanced Retrieval and Search

These guides contain advanced retrieval techniques. Some are common like keyword/hybrid search, reranking, and more.
Some are specific to LLM + RAG workflows, like small-to-big and auto-merging retrieval.

- Define Custom Retriever
- BM25 Hybrid Retriever
- Simple Query Fusion
- Reciprocal Rerank Fusion
- Auto Merging Retriever
- Metadata Replacement
- Composable Retrievers

### Auto-Retrieval

These retrieval techniques perform **semi-structured** queries, combining semantic search with structured filtering.

- Auto-Retrieval (with Pinecone)
- Auto-Retrieval (with Lantern)
- Auto-Retrieval (with Chroma)
- Auto-Retrieval (with BagelDB)
- Auto-Retrieval (with Vectara)
- Multi-Doc Auto-Retrieval

### Knowledge Graph Retrievers

- Knowledge Graph RAG Retriever

### Composed Retrievers

These are retrieval techniques that are composed on top of other retrieval techniques - providing higher-level capabilities like
hierarchical retrieval and query decomposition.

- Query Fusion
- Recursive Table Retrieval
- Recursive Node Retrieval
- Braintrust
- Router Retriever
- Ensemble Retriever
- Multi-Doc Auto-Retrieval

### Managed Retrievers

- Google
- Vectara
- VideoDB
- Amazon Bedrock

### Other Retrievers

These are guides that don't fit neatly into a category but should be highlighted regardless.

- Multi-Doc Hybrid
- You Retriever
- Text-to-SQL
- DeepMemory (Activeloop)
- Pathway

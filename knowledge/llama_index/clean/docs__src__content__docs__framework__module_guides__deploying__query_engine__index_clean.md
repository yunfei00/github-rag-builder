title: Query Engine
---

## Concept

Query engine is a generic interface that allows you to ask question over your data.

A query engine takes in a natural language query, and returns a rich response.
It is most often (but not always) built on one or many indexes via retrievers.
You can compose multiple query engines to achieve more advanced capability.

  If you want to have a conversation with your data (multiple back-and-forth
  instead of a single question & answer), take a look at Chat
  Engine

## Usage Pattern

Get started with:

```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("Who is Paul Graham.")
```

To stream response:

```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(streaming=True)
streaming_response = query_engine.query("Who is Paul Graham.")
streaming_response.print_response_stream()
```

See the full usage pattern for more details.

title: Agents
---

An "agent" is an automated reasoning and decision engine. It takes in a user input/query and can make internal decisions for executing
that query in order to return the correct result. The key agent components can include, but are not limited to:

- Breaking down a complex question into smaller ones
- Choosing an external Tool to use + coming up with parameters for calling the Tool
- Planning out a set of tasks
- Storing previously completed tasks in a memory module

LlamaIndex provides a comprehensive framework for building agentic systems with varying degrees of complexity:

- **If you want to build agents quickly**: Use our prebuilt agent and tool architectures to rapidly setup agentic systems.
- **If you want full control over your agentic system**: Build and deploy custom agentic workflows from scratch using our Workflows.

## Use Cases

The scope of possible use cases for agents is vast and ever-expanding. That said, here are some practical use cases that can deliver immediate value.

- **Agentic RAG**: Build a context-augmented research assistant over your data that not only answers simple questions, but complex research tasks. Our getting started guide is a great place to start.

- **Report Generation**: Generate a multimodal report using a multi-agent researcher + writer workflow + LlamaParse. Notebook.

- **Customer Support**: Check out starter template for building a multi-agent concierge with workflows.

Others:

- **Productivity Assistant**: Build an agent that can operate over common workflow tools like email, calendar. Check out our GSuite agent tutorial.

- **Coding Assistant**: Build an agent that can operate over code. Check out our code interpreter tutorial.

## Resources

**Prebuilt Agents and Tools**

The following component guides are the central hubs for getting started in building with agents:

- Agents
- Tools

**Custom Agentic Workflows**

LlamaIndex Workflows allow you to build very custom, agentic workflows through a core event-driven orchestration foundation.

- Workflows Documentation
- Building a ReAct agent workflow
- Deploying Workflows

**Building with Agentic Ingredients**

If you want to leverage core agentic ingredients in your workflow, LlamaIndex has robust abstractions for every agent sub-ingredient.

- **Query Planning**: Routing, Sub-Questions, Query Transformations.
- **Function Calling and Tool Use**: Check out our OpenAI, Mistral guides as examples.

## Ecosystem

- **Community-Built Agents**: We offer a collection of 40+ agent tools for use with your agent in LlamaHub 🦙.

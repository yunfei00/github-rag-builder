import { Callout } from '/snippets/callout.mdx';

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is Google's open-source framework for building AI agents. Chroma integrates with ADK via the Chroma MCP server, giving your agents access to semantic memory, knowledge base retrieval, and persistent context across sessions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `uvx` installed (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

## Setup

Chroma Cloud is a fully managed, serverless database-as-a-service. Get started in 30 seconds - $5 in free credits included.

  
    
    ```bash pip
    pip install chromadb google-adk
    ```
    ```bash uv
    uv pip install chromadb google-adk
    ```
    

    Then authenticate with Chroma Cloud:

    ```bash
    chroma login
    ```
  

  
    ```bash
    chroma db create my-adk-db
    ```
  

  
    ```bash
    chroma db connect my-adk-db --env-vars
    ```

    This will output your `CHROMA_TENANT`, `CHROMA_DATABASE`, and `CHROMA_API_KEY`. Use them in the code below.
  

  
    ```python Python
    from google.adk.agents import Agent
    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import McpToolset
    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
    from mcp import StdioServerParameters

    CHROMA_TENANT = "your-tenant-id"
    CHROMA_DATABASE = "my-adk-db"
    CHROMA_API_KEY = "your-api-key"

    root_agent = Agent(
        model="gemini-2.5-pro",
        name="chroma_agent",
        instruction="Help users store and retrieve information using semantic search.",
        tools=[
            McpToolset(
                connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
                    server_params=StdioServerParameters(
                        command="uvx",
                        args=[
                            "chroma-mcp",
                            "--client-type", "cloud",
                            "--tenant", CHROMA_TENANT,
                            "--database", CHROMA_DATABASE,
                            "--api-key", CHROMA_API_KEY,
                        ],
                    ),
                    timeout=30,
                ),
            )
        ],
    )
    ```
  

## Example: Semantic Memory Agent

This example builds a personal assistant that uses Chroma as a persistent semantic memory store. The agent remembers facts from past conversations — user preferences, project context, decisions — and recalls them when relevant.

The agent's instruction tells it to create a Chroma collection for storing memories, and to use it for storage and retrieval:

```python Python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import McpToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

CHROMA_TENANT = "your-tenant-id"
CHROMA_DATABASE = "my-adk-db"
CHROMA_API_KEY = "your-api-key"

MEMORY_INSTRUCTION = """You are a personal assistant with persistent memory.

You have access to Chroma tools for managing collections and documents.

## First run
On your first interaction, use chroma_create_collection to create a collection
called "memory". If it already exists, that's fine — just use the existing one.

## Storing memories
When the user shares important information — preferences, project details,
decisions, or personal context — store it in the "memory" collection using
chroma_add_documents. Each memory should be a concise, self-contained fact.
Tag memories with metadata like {"type": "preference"}, {"type": "fact"},
or {"type": "decision"} so they can be filtered later.

## Recalling memories
At the start of a conversation, or when the user asks about something that
might relate to past context, use chroma_query_documents to search the
"memory" collection. Use the results to inform your responses without
the user having to repeat themselves.

## Memory hygiene
If the user corrects a previous fact, use chroma_update_documents to update
the old memory rather than creating a duplicate.
"""

root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-pro",
    name="memory_agent",
    instruction=MEMORY_INSTRUCTION,
    tools=[
        McpToolset(
            connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
                server_params=StdioServerParameters(
                    command="uvx",
                    args=[
                        "chroma-mcp",
                        "--client-type", "cloud",
                        "--tenant", CHROMA_TENANT,
                        "--database", CHROMA_DATABASE,
                        "--api-key", CHROMA_API_KEY,

                timeout=30,
            ),
        )
    ],
)
```

With this setup, a conversation might look like:

```text
User: I'm working on Project Atlas — it's a migration from PostgreSQL to
      DynamoDB. Our deadline is end of Q3 and the team lead is Sarah.

Agent: Got it, I've stored those project details. I'll remember them for
       future conversations.
       (creates "memory" collection, stores 3 memories: project description,
       deadline, team lead)

--- later session ---

User: What do you remember about my current project?

Agent: You're working on Project Atlas — a PostgreSQL to DynamoDB migration.
       Sarah is the team lead and your deadline is end of Q3.
       (retrieved via semantic search on "current project")
```
